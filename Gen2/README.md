# Generation 2 Home Automation System

This is the very stable version of my home automation control system, which has been running in my home since early 2018.  It is very stable and has been generating my personal schedule and such for sometime now.  The code was also created in a proper editor, so the indentation will be much better than what you saw in my **Generation 1** code.

The requirements file might not be fully correct, as on my Raspberry Pi, I installed some Python binary packages through apt-get to simplify the overall deployment.

I had to scrub most of the code of personal information, such as the scheduler.py, so you will see a lot missing and a lot of placeholders there.

This code can't obviously run out of the box, and will need to be modified for your specific environment if you so choose to use it in your own home automation projects.

Like Gen 1, this code is under the GPLv2 license, so enjoy!  Maybe **Generation 3** will be more third party friendly and have some external configuration rather than having everything hardcoded in.  But that is a secret to everybody!
