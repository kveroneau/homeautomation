# Google Assistant Integration for Gen2 Automation system

This is the code for a basic endpoint for Google Actions which I use to allow Google Home and my smartphone to control my custom home automation system using just my voice.

Run this in the cloud somewhere behind HTTPS and point it to your locally running Home Automation System, and link the endpoint in Google Actions.
